# Clowder Code of Conduct

**October 2016**

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Clowder community, as well as steps to reporting
unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all. Anyone who violates this
code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our open source community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient**: Remember you might not be communicating in someone else's primary spoken or programming
language, and others may not have your level of understanding.
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This
includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, colour, immigration status, social
and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status,
political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision
you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
* **Be respectful**: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners.
We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack.
It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* **Be careful in the words that we choose**: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally.
Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t
acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  * Violent threats or language.
  * Discriminatory or derogatory jokes and language.
  * Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting, or threatening to post, people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Insults, especially those using discriminatory terms or slurs.
  * Behavior that could be perceived as sexual attention.
  * Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behaviors.
* **Try to understand why we disagree**: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that
we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our
community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different
perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong.

Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve
issues and learning from mistakes.

This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment,
and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.

## Enforcement

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us via 
[clowderconduct@lists.illinois.edu](clowderconduct@lists.illinois.edu). All reports will be handled with discretion. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the
circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further
details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If an individual engages in unacceptable behavior,
the representative may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a permanent ban from our community without warning.
